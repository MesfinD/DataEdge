We have been preparing the the first [Library Carpentry Workshop](https://mesfind.github.io/2018-01-29-Ethiopia/)  in Addis Ababa University in collaboration with the Ethiopian Research and Education Network, Ethiopian Education Strategic Center and German Cooporation. It  aims to help researchers:

* create, maintain and analyse sustainable and reusable data
* work effectively with IT and systems colleagues
* better understand the use of software in research
* and much more...
