[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) was founded in 1998 and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org)
was founded in 2013 as international non-profit organazation that runs short workshops(2 days workshops) to teach reseathers
fundamental concepts of research analysis and computing. Each Carpetry community had several parts, which  function together to
spread data and computational skills among researchers and other professional wordwide. Now, Carpentry steering committees have approved to work under a single umbrella organization named **The Carpentries** 
with associated lesson organizations starting from January 1, 2018. 

Since 2014, we have increased the number of African Instuctors from 0 to almost 30 today. The upcoming [training in Kleinmond],
(https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/2018-02-21-South-Africa-ttt/) South Africa will  bring the total number of 
[trained instructors](https://software-carpentry.org/team/) on the africa continet to over 100.
