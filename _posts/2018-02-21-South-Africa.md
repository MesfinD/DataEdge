title: "Software Carpentry "
subtitle: "Instructor Training Event"
---

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) was founded in 1998 and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org)
was founded in 2013 as international non-profit organization that runs short workshops (2 days workshops) to teach researchers
fundamental concepts of research analysis and computing. Each Carpentry community had several parts, which  function together to spread data and computational skills among researchers and other professional wordwide. Now, Carpentry steering committees have approved to work under a single umbrella organization named **The Carpentries**  with associated lesson organizations starting from January 1, 2018. 

The Carpentry community is growing!. Carpentry Instructor Trainers run instructor training workshops, lead online teaching 
demonstrations, and engage with the Trainer community about how best to train new instructors. Since 2014, we have increased 
the number of African Instuctors from 0 to almost 30 today. The upcoming [training in Kleinmond](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/2018-02-21-South-Africa-ttt/) South Africa will  bring the total number of [trained instructors](https://software-carpentry.org/team/) on the africa continet to over 100.

The course is aimed at everyone who is interested in becoming a better teacher. In particular, this training is aimed at those who want to become Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors, run workshops and contribute to the Carpentry training materials. You don't currently have to be an instructor or a teacher to attend this workshop, but you do need to be willing and committed to becoming one and to improving your teaching techniques.

Candidates who may be interested to become instructors  invited to apply. We are looking for people who already have some support structures around them (for example other instructors), new institutions (specifically more rural campuses), and preferably people who are already using the tools we are teaching. There is no fee, but they should be prepared to fund their own travel and accommodation and dinner. Breakfast, lunch and tea times will be served at the workshop (as most accommodation is on a self-catering basis).
