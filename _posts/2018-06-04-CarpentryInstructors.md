In particular, this training is aimed at those who want to become [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) instructors for Africans, 
to run workshops and contribute to the Carpentry training materials. Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry's mission is to 
help scientists and engineers get more research done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills 
for scientific computing. This hands-on two-day workshop covers the basics of educational psychology and instructional
design, and looks at how to use these ideas in both intensive workshops and regular classes.
