Kimi ("Keep It MInimal") is a lisp-like toy programming language interpreted in Python 3,
which I created to learn more about programming languages and interpreters.
Kimi is a small, elegant language with a minimal set of features
(see the Github repo for more details).
The Python 3 interpreter was created using Test-Driven Development (with `unittest` and `doctest`). 
A basic REPL is available.
