### Background
The Carpentry Instructor workshop from June 4 – 7, 2018 has been designed to train Ethiopian university librarians and researchers together with TVET lecturers in [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teaching methodology. In the next step the Carpentry Instructor Candidates have to work on their own workshops at Ethiopian university campuses or at TVET colleges. Carpentry training curricula are available at international level. Overall, 17 Carpentry Instructor Candidates will organise their hands-on workshops at 11 university campuses and 5 TVET colleges and deliver their selected curricula.
Since Carpentries (Data, Software and Library Carpentries) in the campuses and TVET colleges have no history, it is important to bring further The Carpentries’ standards and the Ethiopian Carpentry standards already developed by the Ethiopian Team of Carpentry trainers in order to set up a sustainable Ethiopian Carpentry Community – starting from the campus and TVET college level up to the national level.

For this purpose, it is important that the Carpentry Instructor Candidates will be coached and guided. Each Carpentry Instructor Candidate will organise 2 Carpentry Workshops and for these 2 Workshops the Carpentry Instructor Candidate will get support from the Ethiopian Carpentry Team, which is composed of a certified Carpentry Instructor Trainer and at least one certified Carpentry instructor. Furthermore, certified international Instructors will be invited in certain cases to assist the Ethiopian Carpentry Team. 
The Carpentry Instructor Candidate has to organise the 2 workshops in line with The Carpentries’ standards and have to deliver selected sessions from the selected curricula under supervision of the certified instructors. For this purpose, certified Ethiopian Instructors will be assigned to assist the Carpentry Instructor Candidates in preparing and running the Workshops on one hand and on the other hand to supervise, monitor and evaluate the delivery of the trainees.

### Objectives

The supervision, monitoring and evaluation of Carpentry Workshops has the objective to set international standards to all Carpentry workshops delivered by Ethiopian certified trainers. In order to prepare the floor for qualified trainings it is important that Carpentry Instructor Candidate will be accompanied by experienced certified instructors in their delivery of the curricula and getting feedback to their work that they can become eligible for The Carpentries certification process. 
Due to the importance of increasing data literacy at all levels of education, standards need to be set and performances of trainers need to be supervised, monitored and evaluated also beyond this consultancy. Therefore, this exercise will end in a strategy for continuous training for certified Ethiopian Carpentry instructors.
