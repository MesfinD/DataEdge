---

I'm a Computational Data Scientist and Faculity member at Addis Ababa University with enthusiastic in expanding computational skills. Since the fall of 2017, Iâ€™ve been working as [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) ([Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/team/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)) trainer and instructor. In addition, I'm an African task-force member for the The Carpentries and interested in Data Science.

When I'm not at a computer, I enjoy traveling, learning foreign languages, swing dancing and listening to live music.
