title: About me
---

I am a Computational Data Scientist. I want to understand things clearly, and explain them well.

In grad school I fell in love with software development, so I spent the fall of 2015 at the [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com), honing my coding skills by working on: improving my JavaScript fluency, writing functional code, contributing to open-source projects like [Zulip](http://www.zulip.org), exploring CPython internals, visualizing data with libraries like [D3](http://d3js.org/), and making test-driven development a habit.

I started developing software full-time in 2016. As an [Outreachy](https://gnome.org/outreachy/) intern at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org), I spent the summer of 2016 helping test and refactor the Marionette test runner, which you can read all about on my blog. Since the fall of 2016, I've been working as [Softawre Capentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Capentry](http://http://www.datacarpentry.org/) team in Ethiopia.

When I'm not at a computer, I enjoy traveling, learning foreign languages, swing dancing and listening to live music.
