title: About me
---

I am a Computational Data Scientist graduated from Addis Ababa University where I have been a faculty member and and enthusiastic in expanding computational skills. I want to understand things clearly, and explain them well.

Since the fall of 2017, I've been working as [Software and Data Capentry](https://software-carpentry.org/team/)  team in Ethiopia.

When I'm not at a computer, I enjoy traveling, learning foreign languages, swing dancing and listening to live music.
