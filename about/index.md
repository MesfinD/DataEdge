I'm a Computational Data Scientist and Faculity member at Addis Ababa University with high enthusiasm in expanding computational skills in academics for better research outputs. Since the fall of 2017, Iâ€™ve been working as [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) ([Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/team/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)) trainer and instructor. In addition, I'm also African task-force member for  The Carpentries and interested in Data Science. I'm also passionate user and advocate of open source and  open science.
 
One of the projects I am the most excited as a founder of a [R-Ladies](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-addis-ababa/members/) chapter for the Addis Ababa nad other town of the Ethiopia.
